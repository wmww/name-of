A small utility function for converting memory addresses (or any numerical IDs) into human-readable names.

The interesting code is in [name_of.cpp](name_of.cpp).

To try out the demo, run `g++ ./main.cpp ./name_of.cpp -o name-of-pointer && ./name-of-pointer` (or the equivalent for your OS/compiler of choice)
